# HookSense
Machine Learning focused agent that gathers live forecast, barometric pressure, and moon cycle data to predict how good a day is to go fishing. Provides information of what water depth fish will be at, etc.

## Tech Stack

Python: Easy to use Machine learning and Data Science techniques with. Libraries provide value for the prediction model.
Pandas Library: Manipulate and handling essential data
Numpy Library: Numerical operations
Scikit-learn: Data manipulation

### Variables used and API's for each
- Temperature (OpenWeather API)
- Rainfall/precipitation (Visual Crossing API)
- Barometric pressure (Visual Crossing API)
- Wind speed (OpenWeather API)
- Cloud cover (OpenWeather API)
- Moon cycle (Visual Crossing API)
- Historical data (NOAA CDO API)

### Machine Learning Techniques
Prediction Target: Predict whether a day is good for fishing
Classification: Rating scale of terrible/bad/neutral/good/great/excellent
Model Type: Rule-Based Heuristic, Cecision tree (maybe), Random Forest (if there's time)
